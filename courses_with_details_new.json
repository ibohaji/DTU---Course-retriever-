    "general_course_objectives": "Detailed understanding of the atomic scale structure and dynamics\nof materials is a crucial prerequisite for understanding their\nphysical properties, and therefore also for the design of new\nmaterials of technological interest. Examples include components of\nnew drugs to combat diseases, superconductors and materials for\nsolar energy harvesting and data storage. Neutron and X-ray\nscattering are complementary methods that allow investigations of\nstructure and dynamics.\nThe course introduces a series of experimental techniques in\nneutron and X-ray scattering that allow the determination of all\nrelevant structural parameters for molecules, amorphous systems and\ncrystals, including the magnetic structure. Furthermore, elementary\nexcitations of the relevant structural, electronic and magnetic\ndegrees of freedom (such as changing molecular bonds, phonons and\nspin waves) can be studied in great detail, either directly in the\nultrafast time domain or via their spectroscopic signatures. X-ray\nand neutron imaging creates 3 dimensional maps of the local\nstructure within materials. Hence, these techniques provide the\nmeans to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that govern the\nconnections between structure and function for a wide range of\nmaterials and over a wide range of time and length-scales.\nThe overall goal of the course is to provide a broad understanding\nof modern X-ray and neutron scattering, and a thorough introduction\nto the practical use of these techniques in the study of the\nstructure and dynamics of materials. The importance of neutron and\nx-ray scattering is underscored by the very large investments made\nby the Danish state in the construction of the European Spallation\nSource (ESS) and MAX-IV in Lund, Sweden, and in the European XFEL\nin Hamburg, Germany. The Technical University of Denmark is\nstrongly involved in method development, design and construction of\ninstruments, as well as scientific use of all three facilities.",

    "content": "The course will explain and interpret how oceanographic processes\naffect production and distribution of fish populations. Students\nwill learn how various physical processes and mechanisms (e.g.,\nstorms, extreme temperature conditions) affect fish eggs, larvae,\njuveniles and adults, and how those processes can make populations\nmore or less vulnerable to human activities such as fishing and\neutrophication. The course lectures will initially cover key\nconcepts and paradigms in fisheries oceanography and then be\nfollowed by lectures on larval feeding ecology and predation\nprocesses (e.g., fish, jellyfish) before progressing to the\noceanographic impacts on higher levels of biological organisation\n(i.e., biodiversity, biogeography, foodweb interactions involving\nfish). The course will span concepts from individual to population\nand community scales, and from small to large temporal – spatial\nscales. Students will learn how knowledge of specific processes can\nbe applied to advise on how to conserve and manage fish populations\nand marine ecosystems.

    "general_course_objectives": "Fisheries management has global problems because the combined\necological, economic and sociological interactions and consequences\nof the fishery and the management are not considered. The\nscientific management advice is at present mainly based on\nevaluation of single stocks. Eg. the overall biological and\neconomic consequences of data poor non-assessed stocks and mixed\nfisheries, i.e. where several stocks of both target and unintended\nbycatch species are exploited in the same fishery, are not fully\nintegrated into management. The effects of technological\ndevelopment and economic incentives and behavioral changes in the\nfishery are not taken into consideration, which impact the\ndevelopment of both stocks, fisheries, and the ecosystem. Also, the\necological interactions are not integrated into the management\nadvice. Newly developed stock, fisheries and ecosystem based\nmanagement models cover this complexity. This enables a more\nflexible and integrated scientific evaluation and advice with\nrespect to development in stocks and fisheries and considers\nimpacts from environment, fisheries, and management start\nconditions under different management systems. The course will make\nstudents familiar with selected quantitative stock based, ecosystem\nbased and bio-economic fisheries based management methods and\nevaluation models, which forms the basis for fisheries management\nadvice and management strategy evaluation. The course gives\nstudents a basic understanding of the structure, dynamics, and\nfunction of the different management and fisheries systems from an\necological and socioeconomic perspective. It will provide tools to\nevaluate key stock, fisheries and ecological data, parameters, and\nindicators and to evaluate management scenarios before\nimplementation with respect to their biological, bio-economic\n(fleet) and sociological (behavior) impacts, sustainability, and\nrisks (uncertainty/ sensitivity) – like a flight simulator.",

There will be made a general\nintroduction to fisheries policies and their implementation,\ngovernance and institutional set-up. This is followed by an\nintroduction to R in context of models used in the course and\nmethods for basic fisheries data modelling. Simple and advanced\nmethods and models will be used to assess fish stocks and\nfisheries, the side-effects of fisheries, as well as to make\nfisheries management strategy evaluation (MSE) and forecasts. The\ncourse will provide the student with basic quantitative and\nqualitative tools to estimate and evaluate fisheries impact on\nstocks and the marine ecosystem under different pre-conditions by\nuse of the models both in data rich and data poor conditions. This\nincludes estimation of stock specific abundances and fishing\nmortalities as well as fisheries reference points associated with\nmaximum sustainable yield (MSY) from time series of catch and\nsurvey data using surplus production (SPiCT) and age-based (SAM)\nmodels.

Class activities\ninvolve:\n• Lectures covering specific topics, and to prepare students for in\nclass exercises and\ngroup work.\n• Problem solving (e.g. filling in some of the mathematical\narguments to complete equation derivations).\n• Small research exercises to find, analyze and visualize available\nobservations illustrating dynamical processes covered\ntheoretically.\n• Plenary presentation and discussion to provide feedback on\nexercises from both peers and teacher.\nStudents will also conduct a group project in which they will\ndevelop a numerical solution on a global scale to the problem of\nwind driven surface circulation. Students will present the results\nof these group projects in a written report and a presentation."

    "content": "The management of aquatic resources is shifting away from a focus\non single system components (such as fisheries or water quality)\nand towards more holistic forms of management; (i.e. Ecosystem\nApproach to Management). While there are varying degrees of\ncomplexity under this umbrella term (e.g. EBFM or ICZM), they all\nshare a requirement for the synthesis of existing knowledge across\ndisparate disciplines.\nThere are many actors and stakeholders, (e.g. ministries,\nconstruction consultancies, environmental NGOs, fisheries\norganisations, wind energy companies, local governments), with\ntraditionally narrow focuses, who require people with the ability\nto collate, digest and synthesise knowledge from outside their\ntraditional realm of experience, to provide advice with a broad,\nsystemic view. This course provides an opportunity to learn\nappropriate tools and skills for these tasks, as well as an\nopportunity to gain experience in the collaborative nature of\nproducing advice, all while facilitating interaction with potential\nfuture employers. Topics covered in this course include (1)\necosystem services and trade-offs, (2) how to undertake systematic\nreviews, (3) what is stakeholder engagement, (4) the relevance of\nlegislation in advice, (5) science communication, (6) from policy\nto management action and (7) the synthesis of knowledge in support\nof advice.\nThe course is structured around a topical, multi-stakeholder\nmanagement problem in the realm of aquatic resources (e.g. the\nextraction of sediment from the Øresund for construction). This\nproblem is identified by the course responsible, in collaboration\nwith representatives from industry / public sector, each year. In\nthe first class, this pre-identified problem is analysed as a class\nand dissected into smaller components (e.g. fish production, water\nquality, coastal erosion, marine mammal conservation). Working in\npairs or independently, students utilise their diversity of\nbackgrounds and personal knowledge to address one sub-component per\npair, by undertaking a systematic review during a series of\nclass-time workshops and as home assignments. The results of this\nreview are presented in a poster session, held halfway through the\ncourse, where stakeholders who were involved in deciding the\nproblem are invited to attend. Posters will be graded by teachers\nand peer-grading during the poster session. Subsequently, the\ncollection of results and posters from the whole class form the\nfoundation of knowledge from which individuals write an advisory\nreport on the broader, multi-sectorial problem as the final\nassessment. During this second half of the course, lectures and\nguest lectures will inspire management solutions and how to best\nproduce evidence"

    "content": "Untreated aquaculture effluent can contain excess nutrients,\norganic matter, and other pollutants that can negatively affect\nwater quality and harm aquatic ecosystems. Nutrient-rich effluent\ncan lead to eutrophication causing algae blooms, oxygen depletion,\nand habitat degradation, harming fish and other aquatic life. Many\ncountries have regulations and standards in place to control the\ndischarge of pollutants from aquaculture operations. The European\nUnion (EU) has established regulations and directives governing\nvarious aspects of aquaculture, including the management of\naquaculture effluents to protect water quality and ecosystems as\nthe Water Framework Directive (WFD) aiming at achieving good water\nstatus for all surface waters (rivers, lakes, transitional and\ncoastal waters) and groundwater within the EU. Aquaculture\nactivities are required to comply with local and national measures\nto minimize their impact on water quality, such as Strategic\nGuidelines for the Sustainable Development of European Aquaculture,\nBlue Growth Strategy, Strategic Action Plan for European\nAquaculture, Farm to Fork Strategy and the European Green deal.\n\"End-of-pipe treatment\" in aquaculture refers to the\npractice of treating waste or effluent generated by fish farms or\naquaculture facilities before it is released into natural water\nbodies such as rivers, lakes, or oceans. It helps aquaculture\nfacilities in complying with environmental regulations and avoiding\nfines or legal penalties. Treatment of effluent is a key component\nof sustainable aquaculture practices, minimizing environmental\nfootprint and reducing negative impacts on surrounding ecosystems.\nThe concept of the circular economy in aquaculture effluent\nmanagement involves minimizing waste, maximizing resource\nefficiency, and promoting the reuse and recycling of by-products\nand nutrients within the aquaculture production as; residual\nresource valorization, nutrient recovery, energy production,\nintegrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems, aquaponics, and\nland-based seaweed.\nEngineering solutions for aquaculture end-of-pipe treatment are\ncrucial in the sustainable development and efficient operation of\naquaculture systems. These solutions require knowledge on; system\ndesign and planning, system evaluation and mass balances, water\nquality management and processes, environmental impact assessment\nand mitigation, optimization of system performance and holistic\nconcepts for minimizing environmental impacts while reducing\noperational costs and increasing profitability."

    "general_course_objectives": "Typical chemical plants may contain hundreds of measurements and\ncontrol loops. Most control theories (those you have seen in the\nintroduction to process control) assume that a control structure is\nalready given at the start, which reduces the problem to tuning and\ncalculation of a control law. In practice, however, given a plant\ndesign with its process flow diagram, a control engineer faces the\nfollowing problems: i) which variables should be controlled, ii)\nwhich variables should be measured, iii) which inputs should be\nmanipulated, and iv) which links should be established between\nthem? These are the questions that the plantwide control course\naddresses. To this end, a systematic methodology based on\nhierarchical decomposition of the control problem into layers is\nused for designing a plantwide control structure based on process\nunderstanding. The performance of the control structure is then\nevaluated and further refined using dynamic simulations of the\nprocess in question in an iterative manner.\nThe goal of the course is thus to learn i) to manage the\ncomplicated task of designing a control strategy for the entire\nplant; ii) to understand process dynamics using dynamic\nsimulations; iii) to develop and implement a control strategy that\nmeets control design objectives (stabilize the system, optimize the\neconomics, environmental sustainability and satisfy the\nconstraints); and vi) evaluation of alternative solutions.\nUltimately all these efforts are to help develop and operate\nbetter, safer, and optimal processes for chemical and biochemical\nindustries.",

    "general_course_objectives": "Typical chemical plants may contain hundreds of measurements and\ncontrol loops. Most control theories (those you have seen in the\nintroduction to process control) assume that a control structure is\nalready given at the start, which reduces the problem to tuning and\ncalculation of a control law. In practice, however, given a plant\ndesign with its process flow diagram, a control engineer faces the\nfollowing problems: i) which variables should be controlled, ii)\nwhich variables should be measured, iii) which inputs should be\nmanipulated, and iv) which links should be established between\nthem? These are the questions that the plantwide control course\naddresses. To this end, a systematic methodology based on\nhierarchical decomposition of the control problem into layers is\nused for designing a plantwide control structure based on process\nunderstanding and with an economic production objective in mind.\nThe performance of the control structure is then evaluated and\nfurther refined using dynamic simulations of the process in\nquestion in an iterative manner.\nThe goal of the course is thus to learn i) how data acquisition and\ncontrols are managed in an industrial setting; ii) to manage the\ncomplicated task of designing a control strategy for the entire\nplant or a multivariable process; iii) to understand process\ndynamics using dynamic simulations and process data; vi) to develop\nand implement a control strategy that meets control design\nobjectives (stabilize the system, optimize the economics,\nenvironmental sustainability and satisfy the constraints); and v)\nevaluation of alternative solutions. Ultimately all these efforts\nare to help develop and operate better, safer, and optimal\nprocesses for chemical and biochemical industries.",

    "content": "This course will start with a fast recap of development and design\nof single loop control using feedforward and feedback with PID\ncontrol. Special emphasis will be given to controller tuning and\ntroubleshooting of poor performance before delving into control\nsystems instrumentation, Distributed Control System (DSC) and\nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, data\ncommunication protocols and process historians.\nFollowing this, the course will introduce the plantwide challenges\nfor control systems and discuss different approached for process\noptimization in both continuous and batch manufacturing systems and\nthe implications for this type of production planning at the\ncontrol and operation level.\nIn the last part of the course method for multivariable and\nmodel-based control are introduced and special focus is given to\ncontrol of bioreactors in batch and fed-batch operation."

Therefore, it is essential that\nlife science and biotechnology PhD students are trained in the\ncomputational tools needed for data analysis and task/lab\nautomation.\nThis PhD course aims to get programming novices (little to no\nexperience) off the ground with adopting Python (instead of Excel\nand Word) in their daily work.

Since\n1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching basic lab skills for\nresearch computing to scientists and engineers and course materials\nhave continuously been adapted and tailored to their problems and\nneeds.

Fault\ndiagnosis is applied for detection and/or isolating faults in\ndynamical systems. Faults can e.g. be a sensor break down, a valve\nis not working optimal, etc. Fault diagnosis is applied for\nsupervision of dynamical systems in connection with fault-tolerant\ncontrol. When major changes happen in the control object or in the\ncontroller due to e.g. faults in the system, it can be necessary to\nmake changes in the controller/control architecture to avoid\nundesired stop of production, break down or safety hazards. This\ncan be done in a systematic way by using fault-tolerant control,\nwhere the control system is reconfigured or the control object is\nclosed down in a safe way.\nThe first part of the course includes an introduction to the other\nparts of the course.\nBoth analysis and design methods will be presented, the\nparticipants will work actively with analysis and design and real\napplication cases are used to illustrate the concepts.

Products are exerted to geometrical\nvariation stemming from production tolerances, temperature changes,\nload conditions, etc. If design is robust, it means that the\nvariance will not have a large impact on functionality or the\nquality of the product. However, if the design is not robust\n(sensitive) it could lead to the product not functioning, the\nproduct not being able to be assembled, high rejection rates during\nproduction, reduced quality for the user, product failures and in\nsome cases product recalls and even fatalities. The typical\nstrategy to deal with variance has been to tighten production\ntolerances to reduce variance, however this comes at great cost in\nterms of time, money and resources.

Model-based\nmachine learning corresponds to a class of algorithms, called\nProbabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), that allow the combination\nof domain knowledge with data-driven methods, in a very simple\nway.\nWhile Machine Learning has plenty of algorithms (e.g. Neural\nNetworks, Gaussian Processes, Support Vector Machines, Decision\nTrees, etc.) that have the benefit of being “push-button”\nsolutions, they are generally very hardly adaptable beyond the\noriginal design. Our task becomes about transforming our problem\nand data to fit each individual algorithm. Many times, we drop\nrelevant information (e.g. known relationship between 2 variables,\ndifferent noise distributions in input variables), and our results\nmay suffer from it.\nPGMs allow us to include prior knowledge, parametric and\nnon-parametric (sub)-models, and uncertainty about inputs and\nparameters. They are perfect for combining different types of data,\nand, in the past few years, a growing community has developed tools\nfor PGMs, that simplify its design and inference process. Together\nwith Deep Learning, PGMs belong to the forefront of Machine\nLearning and Data Mining research, essential to process Big and\nSmall Data.\nWhile this course is, in nature, about methodology, it is grounded\non a sequence of example applications, mostly focused on transport\nsystem problems.",

    "content": "The course introduces the concept of analysis as an experimental\npractice. By offering the participants the opportunity to\nthemselves use a set of analytic protocols, the effects of which\nwill be discussed and elaborated by peers and experienced scholars,\nthe aim of the course is to open new paths of doing ethnographic\nanalysis. The structure of the course is based on chapters from the\nanthology Experimenting with Ethnography (Ballestero, Winthereik,\neds. 2021) where the writers all use their own practice to suggest\nways of experimenting with ethnographic analysis. Rather than\napproaching analysis as an abstract and solely intellectual\npractice, the aim of the book and its protocols is to convey a\nconcrete mode of action and creative practice for researchers. An\nimportant point of departure for the book is problematizing that a\nfixed boundary between “the field” (data collection) and “the desk”\n(analysis, theorizing) exists or is automatically meaningful. The\nconcept of the analytical protocols links to the history of\nexperimental settings as a site of interest in the social sciences\nand humanities (Rheinberger 1997; Latour 1999; Tilley 2011; Kowal,\nRadin & Reardon 2013; Davies et al. 2018; Wolfe 2018 in\nBallestero & Winthereik 2021). The course will cover a broad\nrange of topics such as multimodal approaches, multispecies\nethnography, sensory modality, decolonization of methodology and\nmodes of collaboration. The theoretical scope of the course is\nconnected to the material turn within anthropology and STS as well\nas the application of “object-oriented” methods and collaborative\napproaches that are widespread and increasingly common\nmethodological tools in ethnographic fieldwork (Tsing, Pollman,\n2005; Maguire, Watts, Winthereik (eds), 2021; Waltorp 2020; Tsing,\nDeger, Saxeana, Zhou, 2020). Therefore, this course invites\nstudents to engage and reflect on both their empirical material as\nwell as individual analytical thinking. In doing so, the course\ninvites students to engage with questions such as:\nHow are we confined by traditional ways of thinking about analysis\nin approaching our own data?\nHow do experimental approaches to analysis inform the production of\nknowledge, the treatment of data, as well as the empirical sites we\nenter?\nHow can we as researchers nurture a space of play opening up ways\nof experimental thinking?\nWhat new insights about our data and our object of study can we\nachieve by applying concrete protocols with method for\nexperimentation."

Using the learned\nmethods, various problems are examined with the objective to cover\na wide range of needs, issues and possibilities. Hypotheses and\nissues are investigated based on possible sources of information\nand internal/external contacts.\nIn the next phase (phase 2) a combination of ideas or directions\nidentified during the research phase analyzes and synthesizes. This\nresults in a problem description containing activities used to\ndevelop a new energy technology product or new energy technology\nservice.\nPhase 3 is the development phase. Ideas are developed to solve the\nproblem and the needs identified in the phase 2. Structured design\nmethods is used to develop the solutions.\nIn phase 4, the innovation work is synthesized into a final\nconcept, which ideally is tested on a relevant group of recipients.\nResult is thus a product or service that solves the problem\nidentified during phase 2.\nThe product from the innovation process is a product report, a\nprocess reported and an oral presentation. The process report are\nown reflections on the completed process and the methods and tools\nused.\nIt may be possible to work further with the identified innovative\nenergy solutions in a subsequent bachelor project.\nIt is expected that the groups participate in Grøn Dyst at DTU with\nthe developed product, just as they can get help with\nentrepreneurship, if the group want to bring the idea to a\nstart-up."

    "content": "Transport is responsible for 800 million tons of CO2 emissions\nannually. Within freight transport, nearly all of the emissions are\nfrom road transport. The EU from 2011 set a goal that over 50% of\nroad freight traffic should shift to rail transport by 2050. This\ncourse examines the benefits and challenges of this goal. The\nstrengths, weaknesses and requirements of rail transport are\npresented, particularly the competitive position of rail versus\nroad and maritime. The course presents service design of rail\nfreight for the three most common markets: intermodal, carload and\nunit train. Methods of railway freight service design for both\nEurope and North America are explained."
