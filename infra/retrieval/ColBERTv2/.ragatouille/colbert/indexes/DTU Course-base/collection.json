Most control theories (those you have seen in the\nintroduction to process control) assume that a control structure is\nalready given at the start, which reduces the problem to tuning and\ncalculation of a control law.

  "[CLS] the students are confronted with an openly specified task which can be solved in a number of ways. the students will in groups have to analyse the problem and decide how to tackle it and design a system that solves it. thereafter the chosen approach has to be implemented. the work has to be documented and presented regularly throughout the course. the course will be assessed on the following 5 mandatory components : - 3 smaller status reports to be handed in and later presented and discussed orally at 3 corresponding status group meetings. - presentation of the final product in the 3rd week of the 3 week period. - a final report of 25 to 35 pages to be handed in at the end of the 3 week period. the grade will be based on an assessment of these 5 elements judged as a whole. the work has to be conducted in groups of 6 - 8 students. all reports and oral presentations are to be carried out by the group as a whole. the final report, however, is required to contain a clear indication of who produced which parts of the report, as well as a clear indication of who did what in connection with the project in its entirety.",
  "all reports and oral presentations are to be carried out by the group as a whole. the final report, however, is required to contain a clear indication of who produced which parts of the report, as well as a clear indication of who did what in connection with the project in its entirety. parallel to the technical part of the course, mandatory lectures on group project work will be given and an ethics module with mandatory exercises.",
  "parallel to the technical part of the course, mandatory lectures on group project work will be given and an ethics module with mandatory exercises. a student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to : \u2022 independently use his / her professional competences to solve practical engineering problems \u2022 work with loosely formulated problems \u2022 explain the main concepts of at least one of the project management methods currently used by the industry \u2022 combine the knowledge and competence from different areas in a larger interdisciplinary project \u2022 conduct a project which involves all 4 cdio - elements : conceive, design, implement, operate \u2022 work efficiently in larger groups \u2022 independently explore the relevant literature and software involved in solving a loosely formulated problem \u2022 integrate different techniques and technologies into a larger coherent system \u2022 divide a larger project into minor parts with the relevant partial objectives \u2022 present the status of an ongoing project in both written and oral form \u2022 present a final product in writing \u2022 be familiar with the english technical terminology to be able to search for information, read manuals and communicate with other specialists in the field. the course aims to enable students to handle a complete system design cycle from concept design to the working product. it incorporates both software and hardware aspects.",
  "the course aims to enable students to handle a complete system design cycle from concept design to the working product. it incorporates both software and hardware aspects. the course strives to recreate work situations which reflect actual working conditions and prepares the student to work in a development group. it builds on the student ' s experience and knowledge from the previous semesters ( 1 -",
  "3 ) as well as the knowledge obtained in the other courses on the 4th semester. the student must achieve the course goals as a member of a 6 - 8 person group. individual responsibilities must be kept. this means that : i. the student must be able to explain the overall idea behind every single part of the system. ii. the student must demonstrate in depth understanding of at least one important component of the system through all cdio phases. furthermore it is a goal to let the students consider ethical questions related to their subject. this is done through a special ethics module.
