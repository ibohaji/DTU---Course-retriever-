        "The\ndominating themes of the course are logic and linear algebra. The\ngoal is to strengthen the ability of students to use mathematical\nreasoning on the one hand and an algorithmic, computational\napproach on the other hand, to understand and work with fundamental\nconcepts from linear algebra. The theory is exemplified by thematic\nexercises. Further, computer software is used to integrate\ncomputational and theoretical aspects of the curriculum."
